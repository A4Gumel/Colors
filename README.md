### An App to Create RGB Colors

This is an app that uses validation. It shows how the RGB channels of Red, Green, 
and Blue are added to the RGB color space to create a color. Each of the RGB 
channels should be added as two hexadecimal characters, where each character can 
be a value of 0-9 or A-F. The values will then be combined to produce a 6-character 
hexadecimal string that is displayed as a color within the app.
The form is presented to a user with editable fields in which the user can 
add two hexadecimal values for each color. After filling in all three fields, the user 
should click a button which then triggers convertion to a color and displayed 
in the UI of the app.
